# Machine Learning Pathway

When we try to learn machine learning we have to make sure what is our end goal of learning the concepts?

- Do we want to learn it to apply it in a real world problem solving solution?
- Do we want to learn to further our knowledge?
- Do we want to learn to further explore the field and contribute to the field?

All the above stated goals have different learning curve and different topics to cover.

### Learning to Apply....

In this case we just need to have the following knowledge about ML:

- Algorithms
- Performance measure of each algorithm
- Which algorithm to choose for which scenario
- How to collect and store data for training
- How to scale the solution
- Various tools used

### Learning for Knowledge...

In the case where we just want to further our knowledge in the field just to stay updated and to understand the jargons so as to work with someone in this field are:

- Basics of Computers, Applications and Cloud
- Basics of ML
- Basics of Application Development and how ML fits into the process
- Understanding the Pipeling of a ML solution
- Various phases in developing a ML solution
- High level overview of different kinds of algorithms

### Learning to Master....

If we want to learn ML to futher our understanding of the growing field and to develop new algorithms and contribute in this field we need to know each and every aspect of the field.

- Basics of Mathematics
  - Linear Algebra
  - Probabilty
  - Calculus
- Basics of Computer Science
  - Programing Langugage
  - Memory Management
  - Environment setup
  - 
- Programing best practices
- How maths converts into a ML algorithm
- Intuition of each and every ML algorithm
- Different phases in ML
- How an alogorithm was conceived
- Update of everyday new concepts being publised in the field
- In depth knowledge of various tools
