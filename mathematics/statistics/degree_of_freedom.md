# Degree of Freedom

let us just take an example. In a set of 3 numbers with the mean as 10 and two out of three variables as 5 and 15, there is only one possibility of the value that the third number can take up i.e. 10.

With any set of 3 numbers with the same mean, for example: 12,8 and 10 or say 9,10 and 11, there is only one value for any 2 given values in the set. You can basically change the two values here and the third value fixes itself.The degree of freedom here is 2.

Essentially, degrees of freedom is the number of independent data points that went into calculating the estimate.

> It is not necessarily equal to the number of items in the sample \(n\).
