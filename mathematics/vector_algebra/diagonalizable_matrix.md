# Diagonalizable Matrix

A square matrix $A$ is called diagonlizable or non-defective if it is similar to a diagonal matrix i.e. if there exists an invertible matrix $P$ and a diagonal matrix $D$ such that $P^{-1}AP = D$  or quivalently $A = PDP^{-1}$.

**Here $P$ and $D$ are not unique. **

The determinat of a diagonal matrix is simple the product of its diagonal elements.

A square matrix that is not diagonalizable is called defective.
