# Convolution

Convolution is a mathematical operation of 2 functions that produces a 3^rd^ function expressing how the shape of 1 is modified by the other.

Here both the process and the resultant function is known as convolution.

## Mathematical definition

Convolution of $f$ and $g$ is written as $f \ast g$. The symbol is knows as asterisk and $\ast$ is different from ‘’*“.

\begin{align}
(f \ast g)(t) &\triangleq \int_{-\infin}^{\infin} f(\tau)g(t - \tau)d\tau \\
 & \triangleq \int_{-\infin}^{\infin} f(t - \tau)g(\tau)d\tau
 \end{align}
