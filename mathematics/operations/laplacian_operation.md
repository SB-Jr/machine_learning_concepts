# Laplacian Operation

It is a differential operator.

It is defined on the divergence of the gradient of a function on Eucledian Space.

## Definition

### Eucledian Space

The Laplacian $\nabla · \nabla f(p) $ of a function $f$ at point $p$ is the rate at which the avertage value of $f$ over spheres centered at p deviates from $f(p)$ as the radius of the sphere shrink towards 0.

It is the seconds order differential operator in the n-dimensional Eucledian Space defined as the divergence ($\nabla ·$) of the gradient($\nabla f$) .

Thus Laplacian is defined as 

$$
\Delta f = \nabla^2f = \nabla · \nabla f
$$

### Cartesian Space

The Laplacian in Cartesian space is given as the sum of second partial derivatives of the function with respect to each independent variable.

Thus it is defined as 

$$
\Delta f = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{\partial^2f}{\partial x_i^2}
$$

### Vector Space

$$
\Delta \mathbf{A} = \nabla^2 \mathbf{A} = \nabla(\nabla \cdot \mathbf{A}) - \nabla \times (\nabla \times \mathbf{A})
$$
