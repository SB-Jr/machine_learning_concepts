# Eucledian Transformations

aka **Rigid Transformations**.

These are geometric transformations which preserve the eucledian distance between every pair of points.

These transformations include 

- Rotation
- Translation
- Reflection 
- and any combination of the above 3 transformations.

These transformations belong to a wider group of transformations called **Affine Transformations**.
