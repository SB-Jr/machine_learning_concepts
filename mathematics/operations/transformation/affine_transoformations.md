# Affine Transformations

aka **Affinity**.

These group of trasnformations preserves lines and parallelism but not necessarily the distances between every 2 pair of points and the angles.

In general these transformations are functions that maps an eucledian space (aka affine space) onto itself while preserving the dimensions of any affine subspaces and the ratio of the lengths of parallel line segments.

It does not preserve the distances between points but it does preserve the ratios of distances between points lying on a straight line.

These transformation includes:

- Scaling
- Homothety
- Similarity
- Reflection
- Rotation
- Shear mapping
- and any combination and sequences of the above said transformations.
