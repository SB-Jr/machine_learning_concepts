# Parameters and Hyperparameters

Like Deep neural network, CNN also has many parameters to train and many hyperparameters to tweak the model. both the parameters and hyperparameters can be divided into 2 categories:

- Convolution Network Parameters and Hyperparameters

- Fully connected network parameters and hyperparameters

## Parameters

### Convolution Network

In case of convolution network we only have the filters for each convolution layer as the parameters. The pooling layer's filters doesn't contribute as  parameters.

The number of parameters depends on the number of convolution layer, the number of filters for each layer and the dimensions of the filter for each layer.

eg:

If we have 4 convolution layer as follows:

1. Conv1 = 64 128x128 filters

2. Conv2 = 128 64x64 filters

3. Conv3 = 256 32x32 filters

4. Conv4 = 512 16x16 filters

In this scenario the number of trainable parameters for each conv layer:

1. Conv1 = 64 x 128 x 128 = 1048576

2. Conv2 = 128 x 64 x 64 = 524288

3. Conv3 = 256 x 32 x 32 = 262144

4. Conv4 = 512 x 16 x 16 = 131027

Thus total trainable parameter for convolution network is = 1966080 parameters

### Fully Connected Network

In case of fully connected network the parameter count is similar to that of a deep neural network. It mainly consists of the:

- Weights for each hidden layer and output layer

- Bias for each hidden layer and output layer



## Hyperparameters

### Convolution Network

We have many hyperparameters for conv network. These mainly include:

- The number of layers

- Number of filters for each layer

- Activation function

- Pooling layer filter dimension

- Pooling layer filter function

### Fully Connected Network

For a fully connected network the hyperparameters are same as that of deep neural network:

- Number of hidden layers

- Number of nodes in each hidden layer

- Activation function for each layer

### Others

Other hyperparameters which are applicable for the full network are:

- Batch size

- Number of epochs

- Loss function

- Optimization Algorithm
