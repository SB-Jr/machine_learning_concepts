# Mean Bias Error

## Mathematical Formula

$$\LARGE MBE = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \hat{y}_i)}{n} $$



## Explanation

This is much less common in machine learning domain as compared to it’s counterpart. This is same as MSE with the only difference that we don’t take absolute values. Clearly there’s a need for caution as positive and negative errors could cancel each other out. Although less accurate in practice, it could determine if the model has positive bias or negative bias.
