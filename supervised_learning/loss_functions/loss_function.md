# Loss Functions

Machines learn by means of a loss function. It’s a method of evaluating how well specific algorithm models the given data. If predictions deviates too much from actual results, loss function would cough up a very large number. Gradually, with the help of some optimization function, loss function learns to reduce the error in prediction. 

Broadly, loss functions can be classified into two major categories depending upon the type of learning task we are dealing with — 

- **Regression losses** and 
- **Classification losses**. 



## Regression Losses

- **Mean Square Error** or Quadratic Loss or **L2 Loss**
- **Mean Absolute Error** or **L1 Loss**
- Mean Bias Error



## Classification Loss

- **Hinge Loss** or Multi class SVM Loss
- **Cross Entropy Loss** or **Negaive Log Likelihood**
