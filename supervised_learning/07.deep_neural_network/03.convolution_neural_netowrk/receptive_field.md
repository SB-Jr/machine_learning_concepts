*The* ***receptive field*** *can be briefly defined as the region in the input space that a particular CNN’s feature is looking at*.

A receptive field of a feature can be described by its **center location** and its **size**. However, not all pixels in a receptive field is equally important to its corresponding CNN’s feature. Within a receptive field, the closer a pixel to the center of the field, the more it contributes to the calculation of the output feature.
